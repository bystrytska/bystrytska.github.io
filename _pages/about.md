I am a PhD student at Rutgers University studying the role of social media in mediatization and the co-construction of contemporary warfare. I am also interested in strategic military communication and the military's use of social media in times of war.

My professional background is rooted in journalism in Ukraine, as well as communication work with governmental and international organizations.
